Demonstrate two ways to create an empty hash,1,{}  or Hash.new
Build a hash with two symbols as keys that each have different strings as values,1,"newhash = { :one => 1, :two 2}"
Demonstrate how to pass a key into a hash,1,newhash[:one]
What is returned if you pass a key that doesn't exist into a hash?,1,nil
Demonstrate how to change the value assoc with a key in a hash,1,newhash[:one] = 1
Are hashes ordered? Does it matter order of Keys and Pairs?,1,They are ordered in 1.9+. two hashes with the exact same key and value pairs will eval the same
How would you return all the keys in a hash?,1,newhash.keys
"When you return all the keys in a hash, what is their class?",2,Array 
How do you see if a key is in a hash?,2,"newhash.keys.include?(""value"")"

How would you add a key value pair to an existing hash?,2,newhash[:key] = value ... or newhash.merge!({:newvalue => 7}) ... without ! to not change original
"Are these both strings ""one"" ... 'one'",1,yes
Make a string with quotes inside the string... in a couple ways,1,"""He said \""hi\"" to me"" .. the \ escapes the "" ..or use single quote 'He said ""hi"" to me' .. even better! OR!! %(this is ""Quote"" here!)"
Why would you use double or single quotes?,1,"Example 'He said ""hi"" to me' and ""I don't do that"" ...double quotes to get single quote.. single to get double within"

Use split and join on strings/array. Is join valid on strings? What does join do to an array? what does it do to a string?,2,"newstringarray = sting1.split ... newstring = array1.join("" "") ... that will build a string with "" "" between each element... it will call to_s on each element and create a string with whatever you pass into join inserted between each element.. returns a string. You can not call join on a string."
